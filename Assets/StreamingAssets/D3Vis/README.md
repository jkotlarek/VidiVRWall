For the 2D visualizations we provided 5 distinct options for the user to explore simultaneously. These visualizations include a [parallel coordinates](https://github.com/jkotlarek/VidiVRWall/blob/master/Assets/StreamingAssets/D3Vis/parallel.html) for displaying multiple values simultaneously, a [network](https://github.com/jkotlarek/VidiVRWall/blob/master/Assets/StreamingAssets/D3Vis/graph.html) for showing which countries attacked other countries, a [map](https://github.com/jkotlarek/VidiVRWall/blob/master/Assets/StreamingAssets/D3Vis/map.html) with user-selectable color coding, a [theme-river](https://github.com/jkotlarek/VidiVRWall/blob/master/Assets/StreamingAssets/D3Vis/theme-river.html) showing the trend in weapon types over time, and a [time-series](https://github.com/jkotlarek/VidiVRWall/blob/master/Assets/StreamingAssets/D3Vis/time-series.html) graph allowing the user to compare different values. Each of the visualizations allows the user to explore different facets of the dataset, and interactions allow the user to perform comparative studies for both macro and micro levels of detail. These visualizations are displayed in the immersive environment above.
