"07/26/2008: On Saturday evening at 18:38, a bicycle bomb exploded in the Hatkeshwar locality in the Maninagar area of Ahmedabad district, Gujarat province, India. This was the first bomb in a series of 17 serial bomb blasts that took place within 70 minutes in various crowded places in Ahmedabad and killed a total of 56 civilians and injured 200 others. The bomb, which contained ammonium nitrate, ball bearings, a chemical powder, gelatin, plastic bags, cloth rags and a six volt Chinese-made battery attached to a timer device and stored inside a carton, was planted on an old bicycle. Even though the blast was of low intensity, it was enough to shatter the windowpanes of the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service buses in the vicinity. A lesser known group called Indian Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the Ahmedabad bombing attacks with a 14 page email manifesto sent to the media minutes before the first bomb blast. According to the Indian Mujahideen, the bombings were carried out to avenge the 2002 anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat. On 08/14/2008, a suspected activist of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), Mohammad Sajid Mansori, was arrested by police in Bharuch while on 08/16/2008, the leader of the SIMI movement, Abul Bashar Qasmi, admitted to his and to several other SIMI members’ involvement in connection with the serial bomb blasts after he was arrested by police in Uttar Pradesh. Six other senior SIMI members, in addition to eight locals, were also arrested, for a total of 16 individuals connected to the bombing attacks. Following the police investigation, authorities speculated that the Indian Mujahideen was just a front name for the SIMI group."	1	1	1	0			1	1	0	3	Bombing/Explosion	14	Private Citizens & Property	67	Unnamed Civilian/Unspecified		Indiscriminate civilians were targeted in the Hatkeshwar locality.	92	India	Indian Mujahideen	The bombing attack was carried out to avenge the 2002 anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat.	0	0	-99	16	1	1	6	Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite	15	Vehicle	3	0	12	0	1	4	Unknown	0		ISVG	IND	11731080182.01E+11	2012	11	30	0	153	Pakistan	6	South Asia	Federally Administered Tribal Areas	Safi	34.563515	71.258813	1	0		"11/30/2012: A landmine detonated targeting a bomb disposal squad from the Frontier Corps (FC) in Safi village, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.
