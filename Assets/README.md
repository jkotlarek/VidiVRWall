The globe visualization implemented in this paper is capable of rendering high dimensional data  (given that it contains latitude and longitude), with the ability to aggregate data according to any dimension, and can modify the opacity, hue and size of elements according to any dimension as well. Moreover, interacting with the globe shows the connections to the [2D visualizations](https://github.com/jkotlarek/VidiVRWall/tree/master/Assets/StreamingAssets/D3Vis).
