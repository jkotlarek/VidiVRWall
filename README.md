We have developed an immersive environment that enhances the data analytics tools available to a user beyond traditional 2D visualizations. Using the HTC Vive VR System, powered by the Unity3D engine with the SteamVR plugin we built a system to study the Global Terrorism Database. Our system consists of a wall of 2 dimensional visualizations the user can interact with to explore both high and low level details of the dataset, and animated immersive 3 dimensional visualizations of a globe and a projected map. Both 3D visualizations are animated to show the connections between data of the separate visualizations.
